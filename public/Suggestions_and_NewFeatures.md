### Suggestions -

> > 1.  Change the color theme according to the mood and emotion.
> > 2.  Make the emotion visualization part more animated, example add emojis according to the emotion (ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜”, ðŸ˜ ), or change the bar/pie chart dynamically according to the emotion, until the final emotion is selected.
> > 3.  User might want to play another playlist, despite his or her mood.

### New features:

> > 1.  Consider the weather as well in determining the mood of the person.
> > 2.  Provide a timeline or chart showing how emotions have changed over time during the session. Once the emotion has been recorded and music has been played, the user can again click on detect emotion button and then another emotion can be recorded.
